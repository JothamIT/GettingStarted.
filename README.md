# GettingStarted.
## Getting familiar with Github.
### This is a great tool.  
Now I just need to learn it and understand how to use it.   
I want to learn how to add media on my doc, how to use R and other external tools in my doc.  
I also would like to use this for **writting blogs.**  

I am a little familiar with [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com). It's a tool I like and use quit often.  
I tend to see a lot of similarities especially with formating structures between the three.  
- Kaggle  
- Github  
- RStudio  

## First things first.
1. How to publish my repository.
2. How to add dataset into my workspace.
3. How to add tools like *Spreadsheets, RCoded, and Media* into my github docs.
